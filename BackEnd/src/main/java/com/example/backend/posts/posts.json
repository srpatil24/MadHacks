Babcock died and left his house to the University. It was to be used as a place for deserving, needy, male students to call home while enrolled in the College of Agriculture. Today, Babcock House is no longer a male-only organization with 24 student residents from all income levels. Most are enrolled in the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences along with other colleges within UW-Madison. The house is operated and maintained cooperatively by the students themselves. The Board of Directors (composed of a faculty advisor, alumni, and student members of Babcock House) acts as the legal, nonprofit corporation holding title to the property.<\/p>"}]
