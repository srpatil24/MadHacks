We host weekly discussions and facilitate field trips on and off campus. Past field trips have included department sponsored bus trips to the Art Institute of Chicago and Milwaukee Art Museum, local gallery visits, and frequent trips to the Chazen Museum of Art. Our discussions range from art news, to controversies in museum studies, to meme analysis. We believe strongly in creating a welcoming and open space for students to engage in dialogue surrounding the arts. We strive to provide resources for students navigating the major. Majoring in Art History is not required.&nbsp;No expertise necessary&mdash;only enthusiasm for art (past, present, and future).<\/div>\r\n<\/div>"
