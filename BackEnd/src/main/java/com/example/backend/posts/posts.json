There is a lack of understanding of what science policy is and how it affects both public policy and scientific research. In order to fulfill our goal of educating students about science policy, we will have public seminars where invited speakers will present on various aspects of science policy. In addition, we wish to keep our student members updated on current science policy issues by holding meetings where we informally discuss these issues in a journal club setting. Being in the capital provides us with an amazing opportunity to work with senators and law makers. We hope to organize a relationship with the capital that affords graduate students the opportunity to meet policy makers and understand how policies involving science are managed and implemented from the policy makers&rsquo; perspective.<\/p>\r\n<p>In order to increase the awareness of science policy as a career, several seminars with invited and local speakers will be organized during the year. Through these seminars the graduate student community will be exposed to different careers and jobs in different sectors: government, private and non-profit. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Science policy issues affect scientists and the general public alike. For this reason, we believe that it is important for the public to understand the value of research and science. &nbsp;To address this goal, we will reach out to the community and educate them on currently relevant science topics. &nbsp;Through activities geared toward the non-scientific community, both in the local neighborhoods and on the University campus, we hope to demonstrate why the research done by graduate students at the University of Wisconsin - Madison is important to the community at large. These activities will provide our members with experience communicating science topics to a general audience. &nbsp;Non-technical communication is a skill that is indispensable for scientists, especially those interested in science policy, where scientists frequently interact with a variety of non-scientific audiences.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>"},{"image":"https:\/\/scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com\/v\/t51.2885-15\/401097174_798746498603262_1331066426918073434_n.jpg?se=7&stp=dst-jpg_e35&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi4xMTQ2eDczNy5zZHIifQ&_nc_ht=scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=B7nOkLRsSEYAX_RyGU6&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzIzMzk0NTE1Nzg5MTY4MDA4OQ%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfA5QVdwsiS2ghj45-AjP60jzHFMdMAQ03Rl2CGjGaizxA&oe=6554025C&_nc_sid=b41fef","date":"2023-11-11 20:58:46+00:00","caption":"#\u635e\u4eba","clubName":"Chinese Students and Scholars Association at UW-MADISON, The","twitter":null,"instagram":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/cssa_at_uwmadison\/","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cssaatuwmadison\/","clubDescription":"<p>More than 20 years from its foundation, Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA) has doubtlessly established itself as the most active and influential Chinese student organization on the UW-Madison campus. We take great pride in our contribution to the promotion of the cultural exchange between Chinese culture and other cultures, as well as the promotion of the cultural diversity of the Madison community. From the first day it was founded, CSSA has aimed to build a prosperous community that will consist of not only Chinese students and scholars, but also those with other ethnic backgrounds who have an interest in Chinese tradition and culture.<br \/><br \/>After years of endeavors by the&nbsp;founders and the successors, CSSA has become the leading group in promoting the&nbsp;Chinese culture and tradition. Take the gala of the Spring Festival as an example. This annual event, which is open to all UW-Madison students and faculty for&nbsp;free, consisting of various kinds of shows, such as traditional and modern dances, singing and talk show. It has been held successfully for more than 20 years at the Memorial Union of the UW-Madison. This event has become so popular that&nbsp;the Chinese students, scholars, and their families have long taken it for granted&nbsp;as an opportunity for union and feast. Nowadays, more and more U.S families enjoy this annual show; many of them even participate in the performances. Other traditional activities of CSSA include the celebration of <br \/>Mid-Autumn Festival (also known as the Moon Festival).<br \/><br \/>There is no doubt that these activities have benefited the Chinese people by adding to their life excitement&nbsp;and communal feelings. By showcasing Chinese culture and tradition, they also, and maybe more importantly, benefited the Madison community as a whole. It should be specially noted, however, that we have not made these achievements all alone. Instead, we owe many thanks to several university administration offices, such as Associated Students of Madison, International Student and Scholar Services, and Registered Student Organization Office, and many other local organizations and individuals, such as Madison Chinese Language Society, to name a few.<\/p>"},{"image":"https:\/\/scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com\/v\/t51.2885-15\/400572257_6960319370699125_9116489682406792386_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi4xMDgweDEwODAuc2RyIn0&_nc_ht=scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=qjJZOwWSrOAAX8TPX8Y&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzIzMjY1ODc5Mjk4OTg3NzczMw%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfCcPYgX2JkKnDJNevvDIhe5swbM6q-qtBzvjdLNV76W-Q&oe=6555B9ED&_nc_sid=b41fef","date":"2023-11-10 02:23:00+00:00","caption":"One more Award!

Using dress forms as our canvas and paper as our medium, we got a hands-on experience in conceptualizing and creating fashion designs.\n\nThank you @andreareyndersdesign for your inspiring and experimental presentation, it was such an honor working with you!","clubName":"Vault: Business Behind Fashion, The","twitter":null,"instagram":"http:\/\/instagram.com\/thevaultuwmadison","facebook":null,"clubDescription":"<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\">Visit www.thevaultuwmadison.com for more information!<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\">Welcome to The Vault, the first organization at UW-Madison that explores the overlap of marketing, communication, and design behind the fashion industry.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_content-wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_content\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_fluid-engine x_x_x_fe-63d9c683b7ebfb3a123facf9\">\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_fe-block x_x_x_fe-block-459a00fac9f80af9764f\">\r\n<div id=\"x_x_x_block-459a00fac9f80af9764f\" class=\"x_x_x_sqs-block x_x_x_html-block x_x_x_sqs-block-html\">\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_sqs-block-content\">\r\n<p class=\"\">Our main goal is to educate our members in ways deemed unimaginable, and we achieve this through <strong>three<\/strong> <strong>tiers<\/strong>: education, training, and community.

We have members involved in all types of hunting, including: deer, turkey, waterfowl, pheasant, small game, and even members that have never hunted before and just want to learn!<\/p>\r\n<p>Aside from offering great opportunities for our members, we do our best to preserve the hunting heritage of America, and specifically of Wisconsin.&nbsp; We are active in promoting and sponsoring Learn to Hunt programs for novice hunters, teaching hunter safety classes, and exposing non-hunters to the joys and benefits of hunting. We try to portray hunting in a different light in order to break down some of the stereotypes people have about hunting by being active in&nbsp;habitat conservation, as well as viewing hunting as a means of acquiring sustainable, organic meat. Also, we are very active in helping our property owners manage their properties through providing working parties and&nbsp;helping out as needed. We also hold social events and wild game dinners for members in order to share in others successes.&nbsp;<\/p>"},{"image":"https:\/\/scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com\/v\/t51.2885-15\/370281256_1364096690895543_6011525415160754883_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi4xMDgweDEwODAuc2RyIn0&_nc_ht=scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=B3Z-WU-qzOsAX-USKMU&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzIzMzI0MDYyNjkzMjUzNTEyMg%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfC10GWQ9Yc95Jjz9-4fvbMNtmaNe99TjSOqH9NOMZD9tg&oe=6553B6F9&_nc_sid=b41fef","date":"2023-11-10 21:38:59+00:00","caption":"\ud83d\udc1d BEE FACT FRIDAY!!! \ud83d\udc1d Bees have been buzzing around for a while!","clubName":"Bees Please - UW","twitter":null,"instagram":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/beespleaseuw\/","facebook":null,"clubDescription":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bees Please is a University of Wisconsin-Madison student organization dedicated to supporting and educating on the local bee population.

In order to EmBark on a journey of mutual healing, we fund the adoption of shelter animals, cover the costs of Emotional Service Animal certification, and assure ongoing support and resources for both survivors and their furry friends. Our goal is to foster a safe and comfortable environment for survivors and their allies while promoting awareness for the experiences and healing process of survivors. EmBark embodies a positive support system regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual identity\/preference, age, ability, or economic status. <\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university chapter will advocate and support survivors of trauma and rescue animals through various venues - fundraising, awareness campaigns, volunteering - just as the national chapter will.

Through these high quality music and dance concerts, we hope to demonstrate the richness and diversity of Indian culture. Such experiences help enhance the cross-cultural diversity on campus. The concerts are held primarily in the premier auditoriums on campus.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Outdoor trips:<\/strong> We organize a Fall Colors camping trip at the peak of the renowned fall color activity in the north woods of Wisconsin.

We also organize ski trips to ski resorts close to Madison and white-water rafting trips to north Wisconsin. <br \/><br \/><strong>Social &amp; cultural events: <\/strong>We organize various events like table tennis tournaments, trivia quizzes and other literary events. We also organize cultural events which provide an opportunity for students to showcase their talents. Through these events we aim to present the rich Indian history and ethnic diversity. These events also provide an opportunity to the UW community to witness traditional costumes, and savor authentic Indian cuisine. <br \/><br \/><strong>Voluntary service to new students: <\/strong>We provide voluntary help to the Indian students new to the Madison campus, to settle down and get acclimatized to UW lifestyle. We help students with temporary accommodation, and conduct several orientation programs for their benefit.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>"},{"image":"https:\/\/scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com\/v\/t39.30808-6\/400297052_18398884246007692_7376034842317641502_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080_sh0.08&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi4xNDQweDk1NC5zZHIifQ&_nc_ht=scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=yhnl2vsAnNIAX-NhhQn&edm=ABmJApAAAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzIzMTE3MzU2OTAxMjkxODY4MQ%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfDvUewUVNr3Bd1RjE92ZqUguJCgXIMG4HbpUZ8_DeDjlQ&oe=6554FC63&_nc_sid=b41fef","date":"2023-11-08 01:12:07+00:00","caption":"Hatters formal pics dropped.

Founded in 1997, the MadHatters were the first of its kind at UW and have seen their humble beginnings boom into sold out shows across campus filled with adoring fans. Comprised of 12 singers and a vocal percussionist, the MadHatters croon the songs of decades past to the Top 40 present.<br \/><br \/>Built on the foundation of goofy guys making good music and bringing fun to the community, the MadHatters have achieved much success in their short life. From filling the seats at Madison&rsquo;s historic Orpheum Theatre and acclaimed Overture Centre, to singing the National Anthem at a sold out Brewers\/Cubs rivalry at Miller Park, to travel across the United States and Mexico, the MadHatters seem to have their world on a string and their opportunities endless.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p><br \/>Currently, the MadHatters have one live and six&nbsp;studio albums and are working on their seventh&nbsp;studio recording to be released later this year. Their first album released in 2002, State Street, had a track earn a spot on the 2002 Best of College A Cappella (BOCA) CD, and is credited as the first a cappella album recorded in 5.1 Dolby Digital Sound. Their second album, 2004&rsquo;s Friday After Class, exploded their fan base, becoming a &ldquo;best seller&rdquo; on a cappella websites around the world. Not For Credit, their third studio release, was produced in 2007 and received two national recording awards, including another BOCA inclusion with &ldquo;I Believe (When I Fall in Love).&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>With their unmistakable attire in their Wisconsin red jackets, the MadHatters are a presence on the UW campus that brings everyone to clap their hands and stomp to the beat.

We strive for traditional dance, while at the same time, incorporating modern gimmicks and Western influences, especially hip hop. Ever since 2006, we have become one of the premier dance groups on campus and in Wisconsin. We have performed at many cultural shows and in competitions both on and off campus.

She is very, very resilient, and the most honest of them all! <3 \u201c\n* \u201cMaya is always giving her honest opinions and is never afraid to speak up during chapter.\u201d\n* \u201cShe is not afraid to speak up for herself and others and that is something I admire of her! Ever since she took on the VP role, she is honest to us wants everyone to thrive and benefit in the best way possible. She keeps us updated and keeps us on our toes! :)\u201d\n* \u201cMaya always stays true to her principles and the values of our chapter. She is genuine and empathetic.\u201d\n* \u201cMaya is always open and straightforward with all of us.

The sorority focuses on five principles - academics, community service, cultural awareness, social interaction, and morals and ethics - to unite their members as \"hermanes por vida\" (siblings for life). <br \/><br \/>Since its beginnings, Sigma Lambda Gamma has implemented national programs to empower their members and women of the community, such as the Young Women&rsquo;s Leadership Program and Emotional Intelligence. They have also partnered up with other organizations to improve political, educational, and social conditions in the United States.

We operate under the University&rsquo;s Division of Recreation and Wellbeing and our Governing Body, U.S. Figure Skating. FSCUW is an intercollegiate team that competes against other universities at sanctioned regional and national U.S. Figure Skating Collegiate Competitions.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our team travels around the Midwest and competes at three regional competitions per season, where skaters can compete in individual and team events.

Additionally, our members have the chance to teach at local Learn to Skate programs.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though we do not have tryouts, we ask that team members have some background in skating. This is for safety reasons. We have coaches who volunteer their time to help us with skills and competitions but are not there to teach you how to skate. Additionally, we ask that all club members have their own skates. This is because we cannot guarantee that rental skates will be available during our practices. If you cannot meet these requirements but are still interested in skating, we recommend that you sign up for Learn to Skate classes through RecWell or a local ice rink. RecWell has a discounted price for students!<\/span><\/p>"},{"image":"https:\/\/scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com\/v\/t51.2885-15\/400243181_719957113522659_4479628805700986439_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi4xNDQweDE3OTkuc2RyIn0&_nc_ht=scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=hBkVz_EhGS4AX_cgBf0&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzIzMTYzNDQ4Mjk5MjUzMDY2OQ%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfAqbTb8ZBPQZCrcxK-hiCLvSH9yxuWkShBIby7dKkFlSQ&oe=6553F42E&_nc_sid=b41fef","date":"2023-11-08 16:27:52+00:00","caption":"Hello everyone!
