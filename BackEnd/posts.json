We have members involved in all types of hunting, including: deer, turkey, waterfowl, pheasant, small game, and even members that have never hunted before and just want to learn!<\/p>\r\n<p>Aside from offering great opportunities for our members, we do our best to preserve the hunting heritage of America, and specifically of Wisconsin.&nbsp; We are active in promoting and sponsoring Learn to Hunt programs for novice hunters, teaching hunter safety classes, and exposing non-hunters to the joys and benefits of hunting. We try to portray hunting in a different light in order to break down some of the stereotypes people have about hunting by being active in&nbsp;habitat conservation, as well as viewing hunting as a means of acquiring sustainable, organic meat. Also, we are very active in helping our property owners manage their properties through providing working parties and&nbsp;helping out as needed.
