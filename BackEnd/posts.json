Our discussions range from art news, to controversies in museum studies, to meme analysis. We believe strongly in creating a welcoming and open space for students to engage in dialogue surrounding the arts. We strive to provide resources for students navigating the major. Majoring in Art History is not required.&nbsp;No expertise necessary&mdash;only enthusiasm for art (past, present, and future).<\/div>\r\n<\/div>"},{"image":"https:\/\/scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com\/v\/t51.2885-15\/400572257_6960319370699125_9116489682406792386_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi4xMDgweDEwODAuc2RyIn0&_nc_ht=scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=qjJZOwWSrOAAX8TPX8Y&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzIzMjY1ODc5Mjk4OTg3NzczMw%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfCcPYgX2JkKnDJNevvDIhe5swbM6q-qtBzvjdLNV76W-Q&oe=6555B9ED&_nc_sid=b41fef","date":"2023-11-10 02:23:00+00:00","caption":"One more Award!

Through engaging events, informative meetings, and cultural showcases, we work to provide deeper understanding on what it means to be an Albanian. We provide a welcoming space for Albanian (and non-Albanian) students to forge meaningful connections, cultivating friendships and a sense of belonging that extends beyond the campus boundaries. By actively participating in both on-campus and off-campus Albanian events, we ensure that our members play an integral role in the broader Albanian community while fostering a spirit of unity, pride, and cultural exchange.<\/p>"},{"image":"https:\/\/scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com\/v\/t39.30808-6\/400589162_18220946389301013_43515818881043113_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080_sh0.08&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi4xNDQweDE2MjYuc2RyIn0&_nc_ht=scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=Z0hBZ5lz_ggAX-dVWH2&edm=ABmJApAAAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzIzMzI3ODk1MjAxNjM3MDA5Nw%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfCztjQhSTmW7OG4dbIeS7CYdLu70eMhkBnaa6L0ZUbW5Q&oe=65541974&_nc_sid=b41fef","date":"2023-11-10 22:55:08+00:00","caption":"You\u2019ve heard of thanksgiving, now get ready for \u2b50\ufe0fARABSgiving\u2b50\ufe0f\nJoin us next week for an ARABSgiving potluck at the on Wisconsin room at the red gym.\nPlease RSVP at the link in our bio so we can get an accurate head count for the event, and feel free to volunteer to bring an item <3","clubName":"Arab Student Association (UW-Madison)","twitter":null,"instagram":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/asamadison\/","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ASAUWMadison","clubDescription":"<p>The purpose and goal of the Arab Student Association of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is to promote the culture and social awareness of the Arab nations and its people amongst the entire population of UW-Madison.

In the span of eighteen years we have grown into an organization with over 1400 members. Our members belong to different backgrounds and age groups. Membership to our organization is open to all.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h3>Nature of Activities<\/h3>\r\n<p><strong>Music and dance concerts:<\/strong> We invite renowned artists and performers belonging to different schools and genre of Indian classical music and dance to perform at UW-Madison. Most of the artists we invite are recipients of several national and international awards. These artists could be instrumentalists or vocalists belonging to either of the two main schools of Indian music, Hindustani and carnatic. Through these high quality music and dance concerts, we hope to demonstrate the richness and diversity of Indian culture. Such experiences help enhance the cross-cultural diversity on campus. The concerts are held primarily in the premier auditoriums on campus.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Outdoor trips:<\/strong> We organize a Fall Colors camping trip at the peak of the renowned fall color activity in the north woods of Wisconsin. The popularity of this event is shown by the rising numbers every year. This is a wonderful opportunity for students to be a part of a truly Wisconsin experience. We also organize ski trips to ski resorts close to Madison and white-water rafting trips to north Wisconsin. <br \/><br \/><strong>Social &amp; cultural events: <\/strong>We organize various events like table tennis tournaments, trivia quizzes and other literary events. We also organize cultural events which provide an opportunity for students to showcase their talents. Through these events we aim to present the rich Indian history and ethnic diversity. These events also provide an opportunity to the UW community to witness traditional costumes, and savor authentic Indian cuisine. <br \/><br \/><strong>Voluntary service to new students: <\/strong>We provide voluntary help to the Indian students new to the Madison campus, to settle down and get acclimatized to UW lifestyle. We help students with temporary accommodation, and conduct several orientation programs for their benefit.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>"},{"image":"https:\/\/scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com\/v\/t39.30808-6\/400297052_18398884246007692_7376034842317641502_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080_sh0.08&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi4xNDQweDk1NC5zZHIifQ&_nc_ht=scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=yhnl2vsAnNIAX-NhhQn&edm=ABmJApAAAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzIzMTE3MzU2OTAxMjkxODY4MQ%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfDvUewUVNr3Bd1RjE92ZqUguJCgXIMG4HbpUZ8_DeDjlQ&oe=6554FC63&_nc_sid=b41fef","date":"2023-11-08 01:12:07+00:00","caption":"Hatters formal pics dropped.

Founded in 1997, the MadHatters were the first of its kind at UW and have seen their humble beginnings boom into sold out shows across campus filled with adoring fans. Comprised of 12 singers and a vocal percussionist, the MadHatters croon the songs of decades past to the Top 40 present.<br \/><br \/>Built on the foundation of goofy guys making good music and bringing fun to the community, the MadHatters have achieved much success in their short life. From filling the seats at Madison&rsquo;s historic Orpheum Theatre and acclaimed Overture Centre, to singing the National Anthem at a sold out Brewers\/Cubs rivalry at Miller Park, to travel across the United States and Mexico, the MadHatters seem to have their world on a string and their opportunities endless.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p><br \/>Currently, the MadHatters have one live and six&nbsp;studio albums and are working on their seventh&nbsp;studio recording to be released later this year. Their first album released in 2002, State Street, had a track earn a spot on the 2002 Best of College A Cappella (BOCA) CD, and is credited as the first a cappella album recorded in 5.1 Dolby Digital Sound. Their second album, 2004&rsquo;s Friday After Class, exploded their fan base, becoming a &ldquo;best seller&rdquo; on a cappella websites around the world. Not For Credit, their third studio release, was produced in 2007 and received two national recording awards, including another BOCA inclusion with &ldquo;I Believe (When I Fall in Love).&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>With their unmistakable attire in their Wisconsin red jackets, the MadHatters are a presence on the UW campus that brings everyone to clap their hands and stomp to the beat. Not only does the audience enjoy the show, but the MadHatters love performing it. Whether it be another sold out show in Madison or singing at your grandma&rsquo;s 80th birthday party, the MadHatters bring the fun wherever they go.<\/p>\r\n<p>They&rsquo;ll dance, they&rsquo;ll shout (shout!) and they&rsquo;ll shake your bodies down to the ground.

Bhangra has given us the opportunity to appreciate its upbeat tempo of dance, and at the same time, to express ourselves. We strive for traditional dance, while at the same time, incorporating modern gimmicks and Western influences, especially hip hop. Ever since 2006, we have become one of the premier dance groups on campus and in Wisconsin. We have performed at many cultural shows and in competitions both on and off campus. In the future, we hope to not only spread the love of Bhangra in Wisconsin but also to the rest of the world through performing and competing.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>"},{"image":"https:\/\/scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com\/v\/t51.2885-15\/399944385_1000009677771739_3017902359951373143_n.jpg?se=7&stp=dst-jpg_e35&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi4xMDgweDEwODAuc2RyIn0&_nc_ht=scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=c5oU4TE30nYAX-3KTiL&edm=ABmJApABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzIzMTcwODM3NjE5NDg2MDgxOA%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfBEXpPR1rfzOkAgqDfIo_dkNJczWSrB_kMRKIiAYQ5sPA&oe=65539333&_nc_sid=b41fef","date":"2023-11-08 18:54:41+00:00","caption":"We are officially holding tryouts on November 18th from 1-3pm.
